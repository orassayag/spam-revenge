REMEMBER!
=========
Each time you change the logic / update NPM package version, do the following steps:
1. Perform a backup before any change has been made, by running on terminal 'npm run backup' or manually to the backups directory.
2. After the change, check that everything works OK.
3. Keep the maintenance - Every change you do - Make sure to update in this document if needed.
4. Do commit + push on Git project repository.
5. Keep the backup update - Every change you do - Update in iOmega (each couple of days do backup there).

ToDo tasks:
===========
-Remove all unneeded proxy logics, settings, and packages + local ip data and all of that.
-Add option to use a proxy IP address and port (socks4). If flag proxy enabled, validate the settings and add the proxy to the connection.
-Third logic - Register new email address + Make a sample of subscription to spam. Await for textbox and button to load.
-If the text box or the button doesn't exist, or the URL failed to be loaded, add to fail and continue to the next one.
-Once button was clicked, wait at least 5 seconds before moving to the next spam URL (from settings.js).
-Make a delay between each subscription.
-Each subscribe / failed log the URL address to the relevant log file.
-The console status logic should look like this:
===[SETTINGS] Mode: PRODUCTION | Method: STANDARD/RANDOM | Maximum Limit: ## | Emails: 1===
===[GENERAL] Time: 00.00:00:08 [-] | scam@wzdr.com (1/2) | Progress: 364/700 (64.24%) | Status: VALIDATION/SUBSCRIBE/PAUSE/EXIT/LIMIT_EXIDED===
===[PROXY] IP: 192.249.53.67 | Port: 64312===
(The following data list in not updated, check again the list of statuses):
===[PROCESS1] Subscribe: ✅  364 | Fail: ❌  0 | Create: 700 | Missing URL: 1 | Empty URL: 3 | Invalid URL: 3===
===[PROCESS2] Missing TextBox Field: 0 | Empty TextBox Field: 0 | Missing TextBox Value: 0 | Empty TextBox Value: 0===
===[PROCESS3] Missing Button Field: 0 | Empty Button Field: 0 | Missing Button Value: 0 | Empty Button Value: 0===
===[PROCESS4] URL Not Found: 2 | TextBox Not Found: 1 | Button Not Found: 2===
===[USER AGENT] Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 1.5; en-us; T-Mobile G1 Build/CRB43) AppleWebKit/528.5  (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1.2 Mobile Sa=== (cut maximum characters)
===[URL] https://www.netted.net/=== (cut maximum characters)
===[RESULT] Successfully subscribed===
-Add error in a row logic + retries logic.
-Each log file will be with the email address of the subscription, for example: test1@gmail.com-subscribe_valid_03042021.txt
-Each log structure will be as the following:
==========
Time: 23:17:22 | Id: 1 | Index Id: 0 | Creation Date Time: 27/02/2021 22:43:23
URL Address: http://www.test.com
Status: SUBSCRIBE
Result Details: Subscribed successfully.
==========
-In all places change to use isExists instead of .length > 0 or .length <= 0.
-After clicking on the submit button in each subscription, wait for 5 seconds (from settings.js).
-Create example in the examples directory to the JSON file.
-Write on READEME.md file that the sources of subscribe-list.json are not attached in order no to spam attack myself.
-Edit the 'INSTRUCTIONS.md' and the 'README.md' files.
-On the README.md file write a note that the local data tested only on Windows 10 platform.
-Edit the package.json file and re-create the package-lock.json.
-Sort imports and delete duplicates.
-Do all the ToDo points.
-Clear the email addresses in settings.js
-Make sure spaces in all files between bottom, need to fix cases like this:
}
module.exports
}
export default
-Replace all 'let' to 'const' and where no bugs - change it.
-Check spellings in files with 'files-spell-checking' project (both files and content).
-Re-format all error numbers + last_index.txt file.
-Clear all comments.
-Remove all debugger.
-Fix all misspells in all TXT files.
-Format all documents.
-Move all complete tasks to complete_tasks.txt.
-Verify all works good.
-Update packages + verify all works as expected.
-Try to find as many spam URLs as you can.
-Clear all configurations, and keep only my email address in ignoreEmailAddress.js file.
-Make a final test - Register a new email + Subscribe to all spam at once.
-Upload to GitHub.
-In the end, delete the .git directory.
-Backup iOmega.
-In all the maintenance projects:
01. Update the 'REMEMBER' section of this document.
02. ' all the outcome of the crawling will be created' comment should be updated.
03. Add to package.json file the 'INSTRUCTIONS.md' key in the files section (if it exists in the project).
04. In the initate.service - const { Mode, ScriptType } = require('../../core/enums/files/system.enum'); - Need to change to ../../core/enums.
05. Check if async copyDirectory( is not with line break.
06. Fix createDirectory - No need for await in createSessionDirectory method.
07. "Validate internet connection works." => "Validate that the internet connection works."
08. "sending emails processes." in udemy-courses project.
09. Rename the function 'getFileData' to 'getJsonFileData'.
10. Copy the logic of 'this.updateStatus' to all change statuses in the main script file.
11. On udemy-courses project, change the "validate" and "compare" functions to "validateFields" and "compareCourses".
12. On udemy-courses project, change 'isExpectedFilled' to 'isFilledExpected'.
13. Change all functions names that return true/false to 'isValidXXX' in validationUtils.
14. -In all places change to use isExists instead of .length > 0 or .length <= 0.
15. Copy the logic of retry on check internet connection in all relevant projects.
16. Accounts re-organization:
a. Place the "Accounts" directory inside 'C:\Users\Or\Dropbox'.
b. Reffer all the projects to this location.
c. Make sure that after each path change the project still works.
